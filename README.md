# team-profile-generator

## Overview:
User must insert information about their manager first then they will be prompted if they would want to add an engineer or an intern to the team or if they would want to finish building their team. Once the information is completed, an HTML of the team members should be created with their individual cards listing out their specific information such as their name, employee ID, email, and one of the three--depending if they are the manager, an engineer, or an intern: an office number, a github username, or the school that they are from.
